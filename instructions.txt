== Programming Assignment ==

The objectives of this assignment are to learn how to develop Java programs,
use basic Java collections, and perform simple Java file IO.

You will write a Java program that compares several DNA strands and looks for
common subsequences among the strands. Each DNA strand consists of a sequence
of bases (A, G, C, U) and is represented as a line of characters in an input
file. For example, this would represent four DNA strands:

UACUCGGAUGUUGCAGAG
GACCAGUUAUACUCGUCUGAGAG
UCUUACUCGGAUGCUAGAGCUAGGA
CCUGGAGCACUCGCCUG

A common subsequence is a sequence of bases where the same sequence of bases
appears in all the strands. The common subsequence can be at any location in
each strand. With the above example, a common subsequence is "ACUCG" and it
appears in each of the strands (2nd, 11th, 5th, and 9th positions,
respectively). We only consider common subsequences that are between 5 and 15
characters long, inclusivly. That is, we wouldn't count the "GAG" common
subsequence even though it appears in each strand.

The strands are of various lengths and there could be more than one common
subsequence that appears in all of them. Your program will need to find all of
the subsequences and then print them out in order from longest to
shortest. See the output.txt file for the exact format and values. In order to
do the longest-to-shortest sorting you may find it helpful to use the
Comparable interface in Java.

This assignment includes several data files containing DNA strands. All of the
data files have the same subsequences in their DNA strands so the results from
your program will be the same on all of the files (exactly what is in
output.txt). You might find it helpful to create custom data files for
testing.

== Compiling and Running Java Programs ==

Compiling and running Java programs on the linux system isn't too
difficult. It depends on two commands: javac and java. The javac command is
used to complile *.java files into *.class files. The java command is used to
run the JVM on a given class file.

Both the javac and java commands are located in /usr/jdk/bin on the PCC linux
system. For convenience, I recommend that you add that directory to your
PATH. If you don't do this then you will need to type the full path to the
command each time. It is necessary to use the same version of javac and java
for compiling and running the progam. If you don't setup your PATH variable or
type the explicit /usr/jdk/bin full command path then you might end up using
different versions of the compiler and JVM.

The examples below assume that you have set up your PATH.

If you have a file Main.java that contains a Java class called Main you would
compile that with this command:

javac Main.java

The result will be a new file in the current directory called Main.class. In
order to run this Java program you would use the following command:

java Main

Notice that you don't type "Main.class".  

It is possible to compile multiple Java files at once by passing all of the
files to the javac command:

javac *.java

This will result in a new class file for each Java source file. Even though
there are multiple class files, you run the Java program with just one. You
run the java command on the Java class that contains the main method.

== Turning in the Assignment ==

Use the turnin command to turn in your assignment. DO NOT TURN IT IN ON
D2L. For isntructions on using turnin see ~mike.noel/classes/all/turnin.txt.
